                    This is the main area (or colimn).You can launch a new career in web development today by learning
                    HTML & CSS. You don't need a computer science degree or expensive software. All you need is a
                    computer, a bit of time, a lot of determination, and a teacher you trust. I've taught HTML and CSS
                    to countless coworkers and held training sessions for fortune 100 companies. I am that teacher you
                    can trust. Don't limit yourself by creating websites with some cheesy “site-builder" tool. This
                    course teaches
                    you how to take 100% control over your webpages by using the same concepts that every professional
                    website is created with. This course does not assume any prior experience. We start at square one
                    and learn together bit by
                    bit. By the end of the course you will have created (by hand) a website that looks great on phones,
                    tablets, laptops, and desktops alike.
