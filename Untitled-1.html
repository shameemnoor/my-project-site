                            <p>I have <strong>experience trying</strong>  to learn HTML and CSS in my graphic design courses a decade ago but it was taught by someone who had trouble teaching. 
                                Only one person in the class really had a handle on things, and most people didn't do very well with his assignments. Some even had to learn outside of class in order to understand. 
                                I think I've already learned more in 3 little 5 minute videos just presenting the material than I understood in his jargon-riddled syllabus. Thank you!
